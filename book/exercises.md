```{tip}
Maybe you're already comfortable with Git, GitHub and the concept of using software to parse text-based files and create marked-up documents. In that case, can you answer the following questions (referring to the exercises):
1. Can you add some content to the intro page?
2. Can you add the file named `file_to_be_added_to_toc.md` to the book website?
3. Can you edit the repository url defined in the `_config.yml`, change the title shown below the logo and change the author as shown in the footer?
4. Can you make a new branch of your book with an additional file `file_on_new_version.md` and view it online?
5. Can you merge your branch into `main` with a pull request?
6. Can you add read-only content from someone else without manually copying the source?
7. Can you fork someone else's repo, and suggest a change in a pull request?

If something is not clear, dive into to the relevant exercise page.
