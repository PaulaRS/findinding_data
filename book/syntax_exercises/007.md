# Part 1: Finding a dataset from a published research article

::::::{topic} Objectives
Find the source of a dataset used in a research article.
Understand the importance of persistent identifiers for data findability.
::::::

**1. Norah would like to access the RNA-seq dataset used in the study by [Mulet-Lazaro et al. 2025](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hem3.70195).**

<details>
<summary>Can you identify the **globally unique and persistent identifier** for the **publicly available data** in the text of the publication?</summary>

```
E-MTAB-15145 

```
</details>

````{hint} Check the Data Availability Statement under Open Research

````

<br></br>

**2. Use the repository link [ArrayExpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/) given in the data availability statement and find the dataset by typing the persistent identifier in the search bar.**

```{Warning} Remove all blank spaces when pasting the persistent indentifier in the search bar!

```

<br></br>

<details>
<summary>How many search results did you obtain?</summary>

```
1

```
</details>

<br></br>

**3. Using the same repository link [ArrayExpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/) try to find the same dataset using keywords in the search bar.**

````{hint} Use for e.g., acute, leukemia, ambiguous lineage, separated by commas.

````

<br></br>

<details>
<summary>Would a keyword-based search be an effective option for this repository, in your opinion?</summary>

```


```
</details>


<br></br>


<details>
<summary>Given the search results obtained in points 2. and 3. is this dataset findable?</summary>

```
Yes, the dataset is findable through a persistent identifier. 

```

```{admonition} Persistent Identifiers
:class: note

Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) make sure the object you are looking for can always be reached via this unique PID, regardless of its (changed) location on the internet. PIDs are registered and maintained by specialized organizations, and can be used by both humans and machines. A PID is used to refer to a dataset in a durable way, making the dataset findable (and therefore more FAIR) over an extended period.
