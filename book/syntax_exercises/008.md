# Part 2: Assessing the reusability of and RNA-seq dataset

::::::{topic} Objective
Explore the information about a dataset in a repository and evaluate its FAIRness. 
::::::

```{admonition} Remmenber the FAIR principles from the introduction: 
:class: note

* **Findable:** (Meta)data should be easy to find by both humans and computers.
* **Accessible:** It should be clear how to access the data, and what are the specific conditions/restrictions. 
* **Interoperable:** Data can be integrated with other data and interoperate with applications or workflows. 
* **Reusable:** (Meta)data should be well-described so that they can be reused and/or combined in different settings.

```

**1. Let's return to our [query in ArrayExpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies?query=E-MTAB-15145). Click the title to access the dataset page and familiarize yourself with theÂ layout.
There are links to all protocols, data, sample metadata and assay type.**

```{Warning}
Make sure the file extension of your figure is correct because markdown differentiates capital letters!
```

```{tip}
If your figure is in a different directory than your chapter, you'll need to refer it using relative parts. If your figure is in a subdirectory of the directory of the chapter, go deeper with `subdirectory/` (e.g. `<subdirectory>/<figure in subdirectory>.png`). If your figure is in another directory, move upwards with `../` (e.g. `../../<subdirectory>/<figure which is located in a subdirectory two folders above the current page.png>` )


```{admonition} Check your understanding
:class: note

Before moving on to the next exercise, make sure you understand the following:
- Where should you upload your visual media files in the repository?
- What is the recommended practice for storing figures in the book directory?
- What should you be cautious about when specifying the file extension of your figure?
- How do you refer to a figure located in a different directory than your chapter?
```
