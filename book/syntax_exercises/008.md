# Part 2: Assessing the reusability of and RNA-seq dataset

::::::{topic} Objective
Explore the information about a dataset in a repository and evaluate its FAIRness. 
::::::

```{admonition} Remmenber the FAIR principles from the introduction: 
:class: note

* **Findable:** (Meta)data should be easy to find by both humans and computers.
* **Accessible:** It should be clear how to access the data, and what are the specific conditions/restrictions. 
* **Interoperable:** Data can be integrated with other data and interoperate with applications or workflows. 
* **Reusable:** (Meta)data should be well-described so that they can be reused and/or combined in different settings.

```

**1. Let's return to our [query in ArrayExpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies?query=E-MTAB-15145). Click the title to access the dataset page and familiarize yourself with theÂ layout.
There is informaation about protocols, data, sample metadata, and assay type.**

<details>
<summary>Which data can you access in ArrayExpress?</summary>

```
Processed data.
```
</details>

````{hint} Check under the MIAME score.

The MIAME (Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment) and MINSEQE (Minimum Information About a Next-generation Sequencing Experiment) guidelines outline the minimum information that should be included when describing a microarray or sequencing study. Many journals and funding agencies require data to comply with these standards. 

````

<br/><br/>

<details> 
<summary>Is the raw data open access?</summary>

```
No. Restricted access.  
```
</details>

````{hint} Check the Data Availability Statement under Open Research

````

**2. Let's access the link to the raw data provided in the Data Availability Statement: [https://ega-archive.org/studies/EGAS00001007967](https://ega-archive.org/studies/EGAS00001007967).**

<details> 
<summary>What do you need to access the raw data?</summary>

```
A data access agreement. 
```
</details>

````{hint} Click the persistent identifier under Dataset ID and read the access policy. 

````

<br/><br/>

<details> 
<summary>Is the raw data accessible according to the FAIR principles?</summary>

```
Yes, it is clear how to access the data, and what are the specific conditions and restrictions.  
```
</details>

<br/><br/>


**3. Considering the information available for the Open Acess dataset in [ArrayExpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies?query=E-MTAB-15145) including metadata, protocols, and sample documentation.**

<br/><br/>

<details> 
<summary>Do you think this RNA-seq dataset is reusable? Please explain.</summary>

```
Records include documentation, metadata, and study descriptions detailing how the data was created, which should enable reuse by others. 
```
