# Part 2: Assessing the reusability of and RNA-seq dataset

::::::{topic} Objective
Explore the information about a dataset in a repository and evaluate its FAIRness. 
::::::

```{admonition} Remmenber the FAIR principles from the introduction: 
:class: note

* **Findable:** (Meta)data should be easy to find by both humans and computers.
* **Accessible:** It should be clear how to access the data, and what are the specific conditions/restrictions. 
* **Interoperable:** Data can be integrated with other data and interoperate with applications or workflows. 
* **Reusable:** (Meta)data should be well-described so that they can be reused and/or combined in different settings.

```

**1. Let's return to our [query in ArrayExpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies?query=E-MTAB-15145). Click the title to access the dataset page and familiarize yourself with the layout.
There are links to all protocols, data, sample metadata and assay type.**

<details>
<summary>Which data can you access in ArrayExpress?</summary>

```
Processed data.
```
</details>

<br/><br/>

<details>
<summary>What do you need to access the raw data?</summary>

```
A data access request. 
```

````md
```{figure} figures/<new_figure>.png
---
width: 80%
align: center
---
<caption text>
```
````

```{Warning}
Make sure the file extension of your figure is correct because markdown differentiates capital letters!
```

```{tip}
If your figure is in a different directory than your chapter, you'll need to refer it using relative parts. If your figure is in a subdirectory of the directory of the chapter, go deeper with `subdirectory/` (e.g. `<subdirectory>/<figure in subdirectory>.png`). If your figure is in another directory, move upwards with `../` (e.g. `../../<subdirectory>/<figure which is located in a subdirectory two folders above the current page.png>` )
```

6. To link and display an online figure, you can use the same `{figure}` directive. Just past in the :

````md
```{figure} https://town-n-country-living.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/craftsman-exterior.jpg
---
width: 80%
align: center
---
<caption>
```

## Adding videos 

7. You can also embed videos (e.g., from YouTube) into your book using the [`sphinx-iframes`](https://github.com/TeachBooks/sphinx-iframes) extension, which is already part of the TeachBooks template. Try the example below using the `video` directive with a regular YouTube URL:


````md
```{video} https://www.youtube.com/watch/B1J6Ou4q8vE
```
````

8. When you're ready, commit your changes to the repository by clicking the green `Commit changes` button.

9. Add a commit message.

10. To see your changes, go to {octicon}`play;1em` `Actions` – The most recent workflow run (`overview.md` / your commit message) – Wait for it to finish – In the summary, click on the link under `Branches deployed` and under `Primary book at root`.

11. Do you see your change? If you don't see it click `CTRL`+`F5`/`Control`+`F5`to refresh the page.


```{admonition} Check your understanding
:class: note

Before moving on to the next exercise, make sure you understand the following:
- Where should you upload your visual media files in the repository?
- What is the recommended practice for storing figures in the book directory?
- What should you be cautious about when specifying the file extension of your figure?
- How do you refer to a figure located in a different directory than your chapter?
```
