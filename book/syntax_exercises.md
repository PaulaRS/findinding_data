# Finding biomedical data: RNA-seq datasets

Norah is applying machine learning methods 
for identifying cancer lineages from RNA sequencing data.

She is searching for reusable RNA-seq datasets in the literature to support her study but is unsure how to assess their reusability.

**Learning goals:**

> 1. Find an RNA-seq dataset for Norah and map each of the FAIR principles to it.
> 2. Recognise why the FAIRness of datasets is important.
