# Finding biomedical data: RNAseq datasets

Norah is applying machine learning methods 
for identifying cancer lineages from RNA sequencing data.

She is searching for reusable RNAseq datasets in the literature 
but is unsure how to assess their reusability.

**Learning goals:**

> 1. Find an RNAseq dataset for Norah and map each of the FAIR principles to it.
> 2. Recognise why FAIR datasets are important.
