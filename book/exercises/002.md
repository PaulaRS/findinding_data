# Part 2: Finding a reusable dataset

::::::{topic} Objective
Use search terms to find a dataset and evaluate its FAIRness. 
::::::

**1. Go to the [DANS Data Station Life Sciences](https://lifesciences.datastations.nl/) and familiarize yourself with the repository.**.

```{admonition} DANS Data Station Life Sciences
:class: note

For the sake of time we will be using the DANS Data Station Life Sciences since this repository offers:

* Advanced search functionality, which the BioImage Archive does not.
* Metadata standards, which the AIDA Data Hub does not.
* A relatively large number of datasets compared to the BioImage Archive (which has too many) and the AIDA Data Hub (which has too few).
```

**2. Do a simple search using the keyword "arthritis" and observe the results:**

<br></br>

<details>
<summary>How many results are displayed?</summary>

```
Around 73.
```
</details>

<br></br>

<details>
<summary>Remember Sam is looking for an open dataset. How many results give free access to the materials?</summary>

```
Around 10.
```

**3. We will select the four cohort datasets**.

<br></br>

**4. Explore the metadata and documentation of the datasets**.

<br></br>

<details>
<summary>Do you think these datasets are acessible? Please justify your answer.</summary>

```
Yes. It is clear how to access the data and metadata and what are the usage conditions. 
```
</details>

<br></br>

<details>
<summary>Do you think these datasets are reusable? Please explain.</summary>

```
They provide extensive documentation, metadata, and study descriptions detailing how the data was created, which should enable reuse by others.
```

</details>

<br></br>

**5. Search for the same dataset in Google Dataset Search.**

Go to Google Dataset Search and use the keyword "osteoarthritis cohort"

````{hint} You can use other combination of keywords and refine your search.

Construct your query strategically.

<br></br>

<details>
<summary>Based on the results from this search and from the DANS Data Station, do you consider this dataset findable?</summary>

```
Yes. They have extensive documentation, metadata and study description on how the data was created.
```
</details>
