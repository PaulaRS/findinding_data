# Part 2: Finding a reusable dataset

::::::{topic} Objective
Use search terms to find a dataset and evaluate its FAIRness. 
::::::

```{admonition} Remmenber the FAIR principles from the introduction: 
:class: note

* **Findable:** (Meta)data should be easy to find by both humans and computers.
* **Accessible:** It should be clear how to access the data, and what are the specific conditions/restrictions. 
* **Interoperable:** Data can be integrated with other data and interoperate with applications or workflows. 
* **Reusable:** (Meta)data should be well-described so that they can be reused and/or combined in different settings. 
```

**1. Go to the [DANS Data Station Life Sciences](https://lifesciences.datastations.nl/) and familiarize yourself with the repository.**.

```{admonition} DANS Data Station Life Sciences
:class: note

For the sake of time we will be using the DANS Data Station Life Sciences since this repository offers:

* Advanced search functionality, which the BioImage Archive does not.
* Metadata standards, which the AIDA Data Hub does not.
* A relatively large number of datasets compared to the BioImage Archive (which has too many) and the AIDA Data Hub (which has too few).
```

**2. Do a simple search using the keyword "arthritis" and observe the results.**

<br></br>

<details>
<summary>How many results are displayed?</summary>

```
Around 73.
```
</details>

<br></br>

<details>
<summary>Remember Sam is looking for an open dataset. How many results give free access to the materials?</summary>

```
Around 10.
```

````{hint} In the left sidebar, check under License

Consider public domain and open licenses:

````

<br></br>

**3. The two public domain results do not align with our search goals, so we will focus on the open access results instead.**

<br></br>

<details>
<summary>How many search results from "The Cohort Hip & Cohort Knee (CHECK)" have X-ray datasets?</summary>

```
3 or 4. 
```
</details>


````{hint} In the left sidebar, check the keywords.

Alternatively, click on each dataset to explore its layout and read the information for both the metadata and the data.

````

<br></br>

**4. Explore the metadata and documentation of the datasets**.

<br></br>

<details>
<summary>Do you think these datasets are acessible? Please justify your answer.</summary>

```
Yes, it is clear how to access both the data and metadata, and the record includes usage conditions. 
```
</details>

<br></br>

<details>
<summary>Do you think these datasets are reusable? Please explain.</summary>

```
Records include documentation, metadata, and study descriptions detailing how the data was created, which should enable reuse by others. 
```

</details>

<br></br>

**5. Let's evaluate the findability of this dataset beyond the DANS Data Station by searching for it in Google Dataset Search.**

Go to Google Dataset Search and use the keyword "osteoarthritis cohort"

````{hint} You can use other combination of keywords and refine your search.

Construct your query strategically.

````

<br></br>

<details>
<summary>Based on the results from this search and from the DANS Data Station, do you consider this dataset findable?</summary>

```
Yes, the data is easy to find. 
```
</details>
