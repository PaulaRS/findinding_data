<br/><br/>

<details>
<summary>How many databases are listed?</summary>

```
~2523
```
</details>

<br/><br/>

**3. Take a look at the left bar and familiarize yourself with the search categories and terms you can use.**

<br/><br/>

**4. To narrow down the search, use the categories 'Subject', 'Object types' and 'Countries'. In those categories, select 'Clinical studies', 'Image' and 'European Union' respectively. This will narrow down the search to respositories to local repositories with medical imaging that cmoply with local regulations.**

<summary>How many databases are now displayed?</summary>

```
~4
```
</details>

<br/><br/>

**5. Explore the information about the databases.**

<details>
<summary>Which dabases do you think are more adequate for finding a dataset like the one Sam is looking for?</summary>

```
BioImage Archive, AIDA Data Hub and DANS are the most adequate. VMH is a field-specific repository focused on human gut metabolism.  
```

````{hint} Remember that Sam wants to find a collection of well documented X-ray datasets for reuse.
