<br/><br/>

<details>
<summary>How many databases are listed?</summary>

```
~2523
```
</details>

<br/><br/>

**3. Take a look at the left bar and familiarize yourself with the search categories and terms you can use.**

<br/><br/>

**4. To narrow down the search, use the categories 'Subject' and 'Object types.' In those categories, select 'Clinical studies' and 'Image,' respectively.**

<details>
<summary>How many databases are now displayed?</summary>

```
~30
```
</details>

<br/><br/>

**5. For "Countries" select "European Union" so we can use local repositories.**

<details>
<summary>How many databases are displayed?</summary>

```
~4
```
</details>

<br/><br/>

**6. Explore the information about the databases. **

````{hint} Remember that Sam wants to find a collection of well documented X-ray datasets for reuse.

<br/><br/>

<details>
<summary>Which ones do you think are more adequate for finding a dataset like the one Sam is looking for?</summary>

```
BioImage Archive, AIDA Data Hub and DANS are the most adequate. VMH is a field-specific repository focused on human gut metabolism.
